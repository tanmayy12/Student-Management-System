Managing student data efficiently is essential for the smooth functioning of educational
institutions. Traditional methods involving paperwork and spreadsheets are prone to errors, timeconsuming,
and difficult to scale. A Student Management System provides a digital solution to
manage student records, attendance, courses and communication within one platform.
This project aims to develop a user-friendly system that allows administrators and teachers to
perform their respective tasks seamlessly. With role-based access, administrators can manage
student enrollments and courses and teachers can record attendance. The system is built using
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and MySQL. By automating and digitizing core operations, the
SMS improves efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances communication within the institution,
ensuring smooth management of academic processes.
